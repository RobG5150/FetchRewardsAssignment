This is my submission for the exercise provided by Fetch Rewards. This application reads in data from the json file in the given URL, then parses that data into one of two lists. The first list will contain data that is complete, meaning that their respective ID's, ListID's, and Name are filled and not null or empty. The second list wil contain data that is incomplete, with its name field either empty or null. Each list first will state the ListID that the corresponding items belong to, then it will list relevant data about each item depending on what list it is in. This project was completed in Android Studio utilizing Java and XML. I have also provided a screenshot of what the application looks like.
